# MrFixIt
> Automatically provides fixed embeds for Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok using existing services

MrFixIt is a Discord bot to automatically generate working embeds from Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok using the existing services of fxtwitter, ddinstagram, and vxtiktok.

## Installation

Open the following link in your browser:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=1213158491213144174&scope=bot&permissions=8 

Discord will prompt you to select a server on which to install the bot. You must be an admin of a server to install a bot.

## Usage example

The bot is designed to work automatically. Completely hands off. Content that needs to be transformed is automatically detected. Future updates may include settings to disable individual services, or individual users can opt out, but as of right now it is completely on at the server level.
